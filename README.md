# Sensor testing
Each of the sensor is tested individually with the ESP32.  
Each folder of the repository is containing a simple code example that can be used for debugging or calibrating the sensor.  
The wiring can be fund on the [wiki](https://github.com/P5A-Enerlog/up_goes_the_data/wiki/Sensors)
Some sensors such as DHT22 are not here because they are part of the library examples.
